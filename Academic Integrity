"...knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful" - Samuel Johnson

Academic integrity is the cornerstone of a university education. Academic dishonesty diminishes 
the University as an institution and all members of the University community. 
It tarnishes the value of a UCSC degree.

All members of the UCSC community have an explicit responsibility to foster an environment of trust, honesty, fairness, respect, and responsibility. 
All members of the university community 
are expected to present as their original work only that which is truly their own. 
All members of the community are expected to report observed instances of cheating, plagiarism, 
and other forms of academic dishonesty in order to ensure that 
the integrity of scholarship is valued and preserved at UCSC.

In the event a student is found in violation of the UCSC Academic Integrity policy, 
he or she may face both academic sanctions imposed by the instructor of record and disciplinary 
sanctions imposed either by the provost of his or her college or the Academic Tribunal convened to hear the case. 
Violations of the Academic Integrity policy can result
in dismissal from the university and a permanent notation on a studentâ€™s transcript.
